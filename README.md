# VErsioner
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EdoardoVignati/VErsioner.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/EdoardoVignati/VErsioner)

A simple tool for everyone for file versioning

# Prerequisites
Install git (I hope this will be done automatically on the user host)

# Development and running
- Clone the repo and import in your ide as Maven project
- Run Main.java When opened, drop a file into the droppable area and click the save button: this will turn your file into a directory with a first commit (the commit message for now is a simple LocalDateTime string).

# Notes
If you like this project pull like ther's no tomorrow :-)
